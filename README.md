# Online Voting System

## Overview

The **Online Voting System** is a web-based application designed to facilitate online polls and voting. This system allows users to register, log in, vote on polls, and view voting results. Admin users can manage polls and registered users, including creating, deleting polls, and editing user information. The application leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with data stored in the browser's local storage.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their full name, voter ID, user ID, and password.
- **User Login**: Registered users can log in to cast their votes.
- **Voting System**: Users can vote on active polls and submit their votes.
- **Poll Management**: Admin users can create new polls, delete existing polls, and view voting results.
- **User Management**: Admin users can view registered users' information and delete users if necessary.
- **Prevent Multiple Votes**: Once a user votes on a poll, that poll is hidden from them to prevent duplicate voting.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: Local Storage (for user and poll data)
